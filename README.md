# href-counter

> A Golang example application which counts internal vs. external hrefs within a page to rate SEO.

The `golang.org/x/net/html` package is used to iterate through all the HTML tokens in the web-page. It provides a working example of parsing HTML piece-by-piece. 

This can be built with the Dockerfile in the repository or through `go get`.
